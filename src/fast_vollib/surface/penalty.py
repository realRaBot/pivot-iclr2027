"""Differentiable arbitrage penalty (design §7).

Because the arbitrage fields route through the namespace-generic kernels, on
the torch / jax backend every violation magnitude is a differentiable function
of the input IV tensor.  :func:`arbitrage_penalty` combines them into a single
scalar suitable as a soft-constraint term in a generator's training loss —
the reusable, tested replacement for the inline penalties that VolGAN /
deep-smoothing / VAE families each re-derive.

Gradients flow to ``iv`` because the penalty never leaves the input array's
namespace (no host round-trip, unlike the inference ``price_*`` backends).

    Parameters
    ----------
    iv:
        Implied-vol grid, shape ``(Nk, Nt)`` (torch/jax tensor for autograd;
        numpy also works but yields no gradient).
    k:
        Log-moneyness, shape ``(Nk,)`` or ``(Nk, Nt)``.
    T:
        Maturities, shape ``(Nt,)``.
    forward, r:
        Forward curve and rate(s), scalar or shape ``(Nt,)``.
    weights:

    reduction:
        ``"mean"`` (default) or ``"sum"`` over each field's violation
        magnitudes.  ``"mean"`` averages over the *quoted* (non-NaN) entries,
        so missing quotes neither contribute penalty nor dilute it.
    shared_k:
        See :func:`~fast_vollib.surface.arbitrage.compute_fields`.

    Returns
    -------
    Scalar penalty in the namespace of ``iv`` (≥ 0; 0 for an arbitrage-free
    surface).  Differentiable w.r.t. ``iv``.
